I spend way too much time customizing vim/bash/terminal/younameit.

### Vim

Here's how my MacVim window looks:

### Bash

I implemented a [Powerline][https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline] like prompt for Bash:

*  Displays the current git branch
*  Changes color if the last command exited with a failure code
*  It's all done in a Python script, so you could go nuts with it

The .bashrc also has a handy function for adding bash aliases for git commands, without losing bash completion:
